# Integrating SPIKE Prime Robotics with ThingWorx Analytics 
## Overview 
This repository contains ThingWorx and Lego SPIKE Prime code that allows the SPIKE to be trained using the analytics server extension on ThingWorx. 

This project is an exploration into the capabilities and applications of PTC's IoT platform ThingWorx, specifically its Analytics Builder and server, and played an important role in my overall goal of this summer: explore machine learning methods integrable with Lego SPIKE Prime robotics to create an educational AI experience for students. 

A simple ball launcher was built and trained using linear regression to better understand how to integrate ThingWorx with SPIKE Prime. Then, more complex methods of training (eg. neural networks, gradient boosts, random forests, etc.) were explored using the SPIKE Prime puppy system, with a MQTT protocol acting as the main communication method between SPIKE and ThingWorx Analytics. 

To the right is a flowchart of the general training process. Although the SPIKE Puppy is featured, the process is applicable to any SPIKE system.
